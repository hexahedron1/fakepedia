    <b>Numbers</b><br>
    <hr>
    <i>From Fakepedia, the made up encyclopedia</i><br><br>
    <b>Numbers</b> are cryptic texts used by <a>Mathematicians</a> to obfuscate their communications. They have been used since <b>874<sup>[<a>what is this?</a>]</sup> AD</b> and haven't been decoded since.<br>
    <br><b>Characteristics</b><br>
    The true meaning of numbers is unknown.<br>
    They use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals">arabic numerals</a>, suggesting that they might have originated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</a>.<br>
    A handful of other symbols have been noticed as well, such as <b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>·</b>, <b>%</b> and <b>=</b>.<br>
    Sometimes these numerals may appear above other numerals: <b>2<sup>3</sup></b>; and on each side of a slash: <b><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></b><br>
    Greek symbols, such as <b>π</b>, <b>φ</b>, <b>Δ</b>, <b>Σ</b>, <b>θ</b> and <b>ψ</b>, can be occasionally seen, which points to a connection to the mathematicians of <a>Ancient Greece</a>, that existed prior to the invention of arabic numerals.<br>
    <br><b>Related terms</b><br>
    Often when discussing numbers, mathematicians mention <b>algebra</b>, <b>geometry</b>, <b>statistics</b>, <b>linear algebra</b> and <b>calculus</b>.<br>
    <b>Complex numbers</b> are often utilized, which seems to be an additional layer of encryption by utilizing 2 numerals instead of one.
    <b>Quaternions</b> are less used, but are likely another increase in encryption, as they use 4 numerals at once. They are likely used for protecting especially sensitive data.
