    <b>History of Mari's bots</b><br>

    The history of Mari's bots is generalized down to Mari copying features she finds cool and also sometimes doing it with AI.<br>
    The first bot Mari has made was called "computer", which was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a> Spoiler Game generator, then later this bot's functionality was merged into a larger bot called "bird"<br>
    Another early bot was bird, which is still around today and has recently passed 250 servers, making it by far the most popular bot she has made. Bird is supposed to be a bot with random functionality, but in practice it is mainly just considered a <a href="https://catbot.wiki/cat-bot">Cat Bot</a>a clone<br>
    Other notable bots Mari has made are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>MariLink <small>Technically MariLink CE</small> - a Cross-server communication bot, which Mari made because it apparently filled a niche, but it actually doesn't in practice. Additionally, it's a copy of a <a href="/fakepedia/p/hexahedra/">Hexahedra's</a> Fiber Optic Cable.</li>
      <li>Unimeter - A bot which is well known for copying other bots and doing it in the dumbest way possible <sup>[wtf is this: <code>module( 'ok brumbler' ; match ) [ react '🦭' ];</code>]</sup></li>
      <li>QT-AI - A small family of Discord bots <small>(QT-AI "Qups" and QT-AI "Qettle")</small> aimed at perpetuating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">Dead Internet Theory</a></li>
      <li>Texas Instruments TI-85 - a copy of a Hexahedra's Calculator bot, notable because tema5002 found an Asexual exploit inside of it, since it solved equasions in an exposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">eval environment</a></li>
    </ul>
