    The <b>history of Mari's bots</b> is generalized down to Mari copying features she finds cool and also sometimes doing it with <b>AI</b>.<br>
    The first bot Mari has made was called <b>"computer"</b>, which was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a> Spoiler Game generator, then later this bot's functionality was merged into a larger bot called <b>"bird"</b><br>
    Another early bot was <b>bird</b>, which is still around today and has recently passed <b>250 servers</b>, making it by far the most popular bot she has made. Bird is supposed to be a bot with random functionality that Mari wanted to add, but in practice it is mainly just considered a <a href="https://catbot.wiki/cat-bot">Cat Bot</a> clone<br>
    Other notable bots Mari has made are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MariLink</b> <small>Technically MariLink CE</small> - a Cross-server communication bot, which Mari made because it apparently filled a niche, but it actually doesn't in practice. Additionally, it's a copy of a <a href="/fakepedia/p/hexahedra/">Hexahedra's</a> <b>Fiber Optic Cable</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Unimeter</b> - A bot which is well known for <b>copying other bots</b> and doing it in the <b>dumbest way possible</b> <sup>[wtf is this: <code>module( 'ok brumbler' ; match ) [ react '🦭' ];</code>]</sup></li>
      <li><b>QT-AI</b> - A small family of Discord bots <small>(QT-AI <b>"Qups"</b> and QT-AI <b>"Qettle"</b>)</small> aimed at perpetuating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory">Dead Internet Theory</a></li>
      <li><b>Texas Instruments TI-85</b> - a copy of a Hexahedra's <b>Calculator</b> bot, notable because tema5002 found an Asexual exploit inside of it, since it solved equations in an exposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">eval environment</a></li>
    </ul>
