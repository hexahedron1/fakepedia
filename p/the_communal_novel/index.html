    <br><b>Chapter I - Attack of the Rat Horde</b><br>
    Once upon a time in a far away galaxy, there was a civilization of hamsters named the Aciremans.<br>
    They lived happy and prosperous lives, until one day, the <a href="../rat_horde/">Rat Horde</a> attacked. The rats brought ruin to the Aciremans' temples, palaces, cities... They mercilessly killed innocent civilian hamsters leaving nothing but scorched earth behind. The Aciremans were starting to fear for their own extinction, as they were defenseless. All of their war tactics were made for hamster-versus-hamster combat, not for fighting off an alien race of rodents! They felt like they were doomed.<br>
    It was yet another dark day of warfare - thousands of deaths and casualties with no end in sight. But that's when... a horse fell out of the sky.
