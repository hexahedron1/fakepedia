    <i>From Fakepedia, the made up encyclopedia</i><br><br>
    <b>Icosahedra</b> (<b>automatus icosadrus</b>) is a class of robots that were created by <a href="../hexahedra/">Hexahedra</a><br>
    They are primarily utilized on discord.<br>
    <br><b>First generation</b><br>
    The first generation of icosahedra was developed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.<br>
    Its features were primitive as hexahedra were still researching the language<br>
    <br><b>Later generations</b><br>
    The second generation and up were built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a><br>
    The features of these are lost to time.<br>
    <br><b>Latest generations</b><br>
    The second last generation attempted to include the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>, but was inevitably lost in an SSD failure event.<br>
    The last generation is lacking in any notable features.
