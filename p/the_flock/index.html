    <b>The Flock</b>, often referred to as <b>the friend group</b>, is a group of creatures that gathered into a group and have been communicating since approximately 2021.<br>
    <br><b>Etymology</b><br>
    It is not known where the name "The Flock" truly comes from, however the best speculation is that <a>fg817sw751478</a> thought of the name when a flock of birds landed near his house. This inspired him to gather his friends into what he called "The Flock" as he hallucinated seagulls in place of his friends. He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and died after driving at 163 km/h into the Baltic sea, hallucinating a cool ass ramp in its place.<br>
    <br><b>Creation</b><br>
    The Flock has slowly snowballed into a larger group through the early '20s. The early origins are unknown as they were a long time ago<sup>[<a href="../f_weasel/index.html">weasel</a>]</sup> and weren't documented, however it is known that growth slowed and stopped at around 2023 as the members became asocial shut-ins that never tried to reach out to literally anyone ever again.
    <br><b>Sectors</b><br>
    The flock is made of three main origin sectors (referring to the way groups of people got integrated into the Flock) - those being named after the people that pioneered them - <a>Zynx92</a>, <a>e_</a>, and <a>Wahlolly</a>.<br>
