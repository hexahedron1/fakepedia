*The made up encyclopedia*
---
Fakepedia is a parody site to Wikipedia that serves as an empty canvas for people to write made up articles about anything.  
It originated as a quirky and weird about me page on [my website](https://hexahedron1.github.io), and after several requests for new pages it has been opened up for the public to expand.  
To add new pages, you may create a pull request or apply to get added as a collaborator (if i know you well enough). The procedure is explained on the [contributing](https://hexahedron1.github.io/fakepedia/contributing.html) page.
